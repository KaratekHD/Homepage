I have been playing around with Gods of Olympus for quite a few time and I'd like to share some of my ideas that might improve this game. I will split this into two parts: one technical and one \"playing\" part. For Players Detailed permission system As a member of the alliance \"Tod oder Lebendig\", I am gonna share some ideas our leader has. We'd like to have a more detailed permission and ranking system, allowing us to rank up users to custom roles, since there are no middle ways between Captain and General, for example. I mean, we don't want to have something like Teamspeak 3's permission system, but a few more customization options would be great. (Thanks to Nyx for this idea) Nectar share for alliances Just a small suggestion: We'd love to see the ability to share nectar with other players. (Thanks to Nyx for this idea) Seperate chat section for more organized support While supporting other people in our alliance, we created a system like this: Everyone who wants to attack writes a number. After that, we follow these numbers as an order for who attacks when. But, unfortunately, this is quite unclear, so we'd like to have a second chat for these numbers. (thanks to Severus Snape for this idea) Technical Native HTTP Proxy support It would be really nice if this game used network HTTP(S) proxys. Some players (like me) are forced to use one and not everyone wants to root his device for rewriting iptables rules. But, for those who want, here is a pretty good app, allowing you to force apps to use HTTP proxys: ProxyDroid . I already asked the support, but I recieved this answer: Quote Gods of Olympus server connections go to play.godsofolympus.net, port 443 to connect to the game servers, but the game currently doesn\u2019t use proxy servers due to the performance impact that would have. Support for more screen resolutions On some devices (for example the OnePlus 6), Tiere are some anoying black bars on the left and on the right of the screen. When using Android Q gesture navigation, even at the bottom of the screen appears a black bar. It would be amazing if this was fixed! comments:","title":"Feature requests for Gods of Olympus"},{"location":"GodsOfOlympus/request/#for-players","text":"","title":"For Players"},{"location":"GodsOfOlympus/request/#detailed-permission-system","text":"As a member of the alliance \"Tod oder Lebendig\", I am gonna share some ideas our leader has.
